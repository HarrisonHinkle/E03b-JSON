# E03b-JSON
I completed this assignment for my IU Game Technology course by forking the orginal copy of this repository and making the specified changes to all aspect of it. I edited the LICENSE to have my name, edited the README to explain what I have done and made numerous changes to the zork.json that were outline in the in the orignal repository. Those were:

- Change the exit in FORE3 from UP to DOWN
 - Add a desc in MGRAT: "If you stay here much longer, you will be eaten by a Grue"
 - In MIRR2, add a new exit, "NORTH" with a target of MIRR1
 - In BATS, add a description: "This is a cave full of bats. They are currently sleeping"
 - In MINE7, add a new item, a "SIGN" with a description that reads "A sign is here that points down". You don't need to add a "TAKE" key/value.
 - IN FCHMP, MRDE, MRDW, MRGE, MRGW, and PCELL add a description: "You are stuck with no way out!"
 - Add new exit in BKENT called "ROB" with a target of "BKVAU"
 - In EGYPT, add a new item, a "MUMMY" with a description that reads "An ancient Egyptian mummy is sprawled on the floor". If the player tries to "TAKE" it, the response should be "You stuff the mummy in to your sack".
 - In DEAD7, change the description to "You have reached a dead end"
 - In CP change the name to "Just a room (not at all suspicious)"
